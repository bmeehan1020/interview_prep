# CTCI 1.1
# Implement algorithm to determine if string has all unique chars
# What if you can't use additional DS?

# Pythonic = Sets: if length of set of string is same as length of string O(n)
# Pythonic = (char_set = [False] * 128) create array quickly, index using ord()
# bit vector = stored in single variable, obj = 28 bytes * 8 = 224 bits > 128 (ASCII)
# dict = key: char, val: freq
