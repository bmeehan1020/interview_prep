CTCI 6.1
You have 20 pill bottles. 19 bottles have 1.0g pills, but one has pills
that weigh 1.1g. Given a scale that provides an exact measurement, how
do you find the heavy bottle? You can only use the scale once

















Place 1 pill from bottle 1, 2 from bottle 2 ...
If all pills weighed 1.0g, expected scale weight would be 
1+2+...+20 = (21)(20)/2 = 210g
if bottle 13 heavier, adds an extra 0.1g*13=1.3g so weight would be 211.3g

heavy bottle # = (weight - 210)/0.1
